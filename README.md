# CalculationOfARectangleArea
Please write a program that follows the rules of object oriented programmingand will calculate the area of the rectangle.
Hints:
- we need to create two classes, one RectangleArea for logicof our program and the Main class for using our logic.
- in the Main class we create the RectangleArea object and call three methodson it.
The methods we should create:
a) getData(), gets side lengths from the user.
b) computeField(), performs computation.
c) fieldDisplay(), displays info and result.
